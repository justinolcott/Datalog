- A Datalog Interpreter along with a relational database, data parser, and data scanner.

  2. Data Parser that reads a datalog program and builds a data structure.
  3. Relational Database: An interpreter that uses relational database operations to evaluate queries.
  4. Datalog Interpreter: Uses the relational database and new operations to evaluate the rules in a Datalog program.
